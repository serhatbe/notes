<p>Learn to stop at 80% mark in eating, talking, and working to stay
sharp, leave space for others, and keep your energy for what matters.
The idea of stopping at 80% comes from the Japanese concept hara hachi
bu, which means eating until you’re about 80% full. This idea can also
be applied to other areas of life, like conversations and work, to help
improve communication and productivity.</p>
<p>In conversations: Refrain from over-explaining or dominating the
conversation. This creates space for others to share and encourages
active listening, leading to more meaningful exchanges. For example, in
a meeting, share your thoughts clearly but leave room for others to add
their ideas. Even if you’re passionate about the topic, resist the urge
to ramble.</p>
<p>In work: Know when you’ve hit the point of diminishing returns, when
extra effort won’t produce much more progress. Stopping before burnout
helps you recharge and stay productive. For instance, if you’ve made
good progress on a report but feel mentally drained, take a break
instead of forcing yourself to finish. You’ll return with fresh energy
and clearer thinking.</p>
