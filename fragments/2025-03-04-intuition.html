Intuition</h1>

<p>Reflect on what youâ€™ve read and written. Information becomes
knowledge by reflection. Reflection cultivates intuition. Abundant
intuition makes up for the lack of information, thereby enabling you to
operate where your knowledge is limited.</p>
<p>This principle aligns with learning theory, cognitive science, and
decision-making.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflection strengthens understanding by consolidating knowledge
through critical thinking.</li>
<li>Intuition, developed through reflection and experience, recognizes
patterns based on past experiences, as seen in expertise
development.</li>
<li>Reflection enables effective decision-making under uncertainty, as
seen in fields like medicine, engineering, and chess, where seasoned
practitioners rely on intuition.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, reflection turns raw data into actionable knowledge, making
this principle sound and useful.</p>
