Learn to stop at the 80% limit while eating, talking, and working: The concept of stopping at the 80% limit stems from the Japanese philosophy of hara hachi bu, which means eating until you’re 80% full. This concept can be applied to many areas of life, such as talking and working, to improve communication and productivity.

When talking, refrain from over-explaining or dominating the conversation. This fosters active listening, balance, and space for others, resulting in more meaningful interactions. For instance, during a meeting, clearly share your perspective but leave room for others to contribute. Avoid over-explaining or rambling, even if you’re passionate about the topic.

When working, recognize when you’ve reached diminishing returns and stop pushing further to prevent burnout. This allows you to recharge and maintain productivity. For example, if you’re writing a report and have made significant progress but are feeling mentally fatigued, take a break instead of forcing yourself to complete the task. This can help you return with fresh ideas and a clearer mind.
