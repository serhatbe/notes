When we travel, there is almost no downtime as we hop from one place to another. Exploration is wonderful. Seeing extraordinary places, nature, and culture often leaves us in overwhelming awe, yet these moments tend to slip away with time, leaving only fragments in our long-term memory. What is almost permanently stored in the mind, however, are some ordinary parts of experiences and the sensations they evoked: a quiet street with rundown houses, yet somehow charming, or a walk on flat terrain by the rice fields, bringing truly remarkable emotions despite seemingly unremarkable perceptions for most people. I find this hard to grasp and somewhat bizarre, but I must accept it. Ordinary sights, extraordinary memories.
